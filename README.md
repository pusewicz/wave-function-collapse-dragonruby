# Wave Function Collapse in DragonRuby

This repository is an example implementation of the [Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) algorithm using [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game).

The algorithm is used to generate the entire map using tiles based on the rules. Rules are defined using the [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) program and read by the Ruby program from the [TSJ](https://github.com/pusewicz/wave-function-collapse-dragonruby/blob/main/assets/map.tsj) file.
